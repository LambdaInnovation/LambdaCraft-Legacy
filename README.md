LambdaCraft-Legacy
===

LambdaCraft is a mod with theme of the legendary game [Half-Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life). It adds lots of equipments, weapons and mobs, and even the XEN dimension for you to craft and explore.

LamdaCraft is the very first mod that LambdaInnovation have ever created. Recently we decided to rewrite the project completely, so this repository is deprecated and is just used for future code reference. You can checkout the new project [HERE](https://github.com/LambdaInnovation/LambdaCraft).
